                            <span>It is lot easier to write essay for Kisor than a testimony. Testimony is too small & too few words !! However, I am also afraid of writing too long for Kisor as well, cause he might just reject this testimony, saying this is too good & he doesn't deserve it. There would be very few guy as humble as him. 
I can say, he is almost like a kid when it comes to friends. One minute, we have argument, next he has forgotten everything & we are laughing again... A bit stubborn like a kid too... But, Oh my god, he is so sharp & quick thinking.. when at office, we are struggling just to understand problem, he already has 4 possible solutions for you. Its like we are still thinking what to eat, how to eat & he has already washed his hands after eating !!
Wish you all the very best for your life ahead, Kisor. I am sure, Meemi will be happiest with you. Although, it wouldn't be too much in saying that only Meemi can handle you ;)

                "YES" is how I define my Bro, meaning, when ever we ask for anything -help,solution,anything, he has already decided the answer, yes 'YES' . That pretty much summed up everything about him.Oh yes he is the best cook I have ever met after my wife... I met him for the first time at Columbus and the very first day I already felt warm of a very caring brother...though I am eldest in my family, I do not miss it after I came across him...
Creativity...this website is the testimony by itself!
Lot more too write ( to be continue ... )<br />
Tamo : Wish you all the happiness of the world, happy married life!!!

                Yummy Food is the first thing that comes to my mind when I hear Kisor's name: D It is difficult to write about him in a few words, but I am going to try. Heart of gold, AWESOME COOK, caring friend, always ready to help anyone and by anyone I mean anyone, very creative, great programmer, biker, photographer, quick learner and the list goes on. Mee and Kisore compliment each other and are going to be a perfect couple. I wish both of you all the very best for your new innings together.

As the impending date looms closer, I cannot help but share in Kaka Khaba's (Kunjakishor Maimom) joy and nervousness. Now what to say about Kaka Khaba... From the rest of these comments, it's very obvious everyone regards him highly. From his warm and fuzzy personilty to his endless generosity, Kaka is truly a perfect role model for a youngin like me. I wish all the luck in the world as he turns a new page in his life with Nene Meemi. I know you two will be an awesome couple, awesome parents, awesome grandparents, etc... An angel only deserves another angel. Congratulations and have lots of fun!

Kunjakishore is without doubt one of my good friends. We first met about 5 months ago,  I am glad to be connected. with this guy who is passionate, kind, and is a great friend. We have a very common taste of music, we did jamming together on few occassions . I don't want to miss to mention about his great love for cooking and much more than that we all love to eat his recipes. Here it goes - Wedding wishes for my dear friend. I hope your life together will be filled with joy, happiness and lots of love. May you always find in each other the love, laughter and happiness that only partners in life share!!!

Cheers. Nishi
